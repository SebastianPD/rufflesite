	<font size="11">The VOTING RIGHTS ACT is a civil rights law designed to ensure fair minority representation in Congress. The state of Hamilton has a large [Ethnicity] population, but NO [ETHNIC GROUP] CONGRESSPEOPLE. Since Hamilton GAINED A NEW DISTRICT in the last census, we can now ADD A PREDOMINANTLY [ETHNIC GROUP2] DISTRICT in compliance with this law.</font>
