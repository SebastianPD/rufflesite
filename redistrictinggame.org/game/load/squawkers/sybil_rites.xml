            <comment>CLUE has no objections to that plan. Your districts are contiguous and obey the rules of redistricting.

            <comment>The courts may not agree, but CLUE doesn't think those districts are contiguous enough. We're going to sue.

            <comment>Have you no shame?! Your districts aren't contiguous! There's not a judge in the country that would let it stand!  We'll see you in court!
