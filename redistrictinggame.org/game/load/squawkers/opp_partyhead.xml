            <comment>Well done! You've crafted a plan that is obviously fair and bipartisan. The [OppParty group] Party is behind you 100%.  I'll see to it that all the [OppParty]s in the State Legislature vote "Yea".</comment>

            <comment>Well, [Rep] doesn't like your plan very much, but it is in the best interests of the party. In the spirit of bi-partisanship, I'll let the State Legislator's vote their conscience on it.</comment>

            <comment>While the [OppParty group] Party supports this bipartisan plan, [Rep] does not, and [Rep pronoun] can tie up enough votes in the State Legislature to block it. You'll have to appease [Rep possesive] before the plan can be passed.</comment>
