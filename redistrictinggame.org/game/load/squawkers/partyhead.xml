            <comment>Unfortunately, [Rep] doesn't like that plan very much, and [Rep pronoun] can tie up enough votes in the State Legislature to block it. You'll have to appease [Rep possesive] before the plan can be passed.</comment>

            <comment>Sorry, but [Rep] isn't happy with that plan. [Rep pronoun] is going to have to run in too tight a race.  You'll have to appease [Rep possesive] before I'll let the [Party] in the State Legislature vote for that plan.</comment>

            <comment>Well done! You've crafted a plan that establishes population equality. The party is behind you 100%.  I'll see to it that all the [Party]s in the State Legislature vote "Yea".
