            <comment>I suppose that plan could be worse for us, but your hands are obviously tied by the [OppParty]s. I suppose I'll vote "Yea".</comment>

            <comment>It seems [Rep] doesn't like your plan very much, but it is in the best interests of the party. I'll vote "Yea".</comment>

            <comment>Unfortunately, [Rep] doesn't like that plan very much, and [Rep pronoun] is too important not to appease. If you don't craft a plan to [Rep possesive] liking, I'll have to vote "Nay".</comment>

            <comment>Sorry, but [Rep] isn't happy with that plan. [Rep pronoun] is going to have to run in too tight a race.  If you don't appease [Rep possesive], I'll have to vote "Nay".</comment>

            <comment>Sorry, but too many incumbents are unhappy with that plan.  If you don't appease them, I'll have to vote "Nay".</comment>

            <comment>The [OppParty]s have already stolen a district by unfair gerrymandering! If you want real reform, you'll have to give us a new seat!</comment>
