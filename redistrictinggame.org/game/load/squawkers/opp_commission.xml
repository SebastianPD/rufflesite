            <comment>You call this reform?! That plan is a blatant example of partisanship in action! The people of [State] deserve better! I vote "Nay"!</comment>

            <comment>Well, [Rep] doesn't like your plan very much, but it is in the best interests of the [OppParty]s. In the spirit of bi-partisanship, I'll vote "Yea".</comment>

            <comment>While the [OppParty group] Party supports this bipartisan plan, [Rep] does not, and [Rep pronoun] is too important not to appease.  If you don't craft a plan to [Rep possesive] liking, I'll have to vote "Nay".</comment>

            <comment>[Rep] isn't happy with that plan. [Rep pronoun] is going to have to run in too tight a race.  If you don't appease [Rep possesive], I'll have to vote "Nay".</comment>

            <comment>Too many [OppParty group] incumbents are unhappy with that plan.  If you don't appease them, I'll have to vote "Nay".</comment>

            <comment>The [OppParty]s have already stolen a district by unfair gerrymandering! If you want real reform, you'll have to give us a new seat!</comment>
