            <comment>Sure, you can play fair when everybody's voting for you! But if this state had more [OppParty]s, you'd be playing more dirty tricks!</comment>

            <comment>I voted "Yea", but it looks like I'm outvoted. Neither party seems to like that plan.You'll have to go back to the map and appease them.</comment>
