            <comment>Your districts all look fairly compact.  WOW doesn't see any need to bring your plan to court.

            <comment>Those districts aren't very compact.  We don't know if we'll win, but WOW is taking that plan to court.

            <comment>That plan is an outrage to WOW!  Your districts violate compactness left and right! We're going to sue, and I bet we'll win!
